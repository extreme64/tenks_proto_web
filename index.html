            Mltiplayer top-down strategy/shooter game. In this mode, two teams compete against each
            other to reach a certain number of kills, usually set to 20, 50, or 100. The objective of the game is to
            eliminate as

          </p>
          <p class="game-loby__main__p">
            Players typically have several tank types to choose from. Equipment is set before game but players can also
            collect
            ammunition or boosts scattered throughout the map. The game continues until one team reaches the designated

            In Team Deathmatch, players earn points for killing enemy players, and they lose points for being killed by

            Points are used to rank players on a leaderboard, and the player with the most points at the end of the game

            Capture The Flag (CTF) is a popular game mode in which two teams compete against each other to capture a
            flag
            placed in
            the opponent’s territory and bring it back to their own base. The objective of the game is to gain control
            of
            the flag
            and protect it from the enemy team. The team that captures the flag the most times within a set time limit
            wins
            the
            game.
          </p>
          <p class="game-loby__main__p">
            Each team has a designated base, where their flag is located, and the teams must defend their flag while
            attempting to
            capture the opponent’s flag. Players can respawn after they are killed, and the game often involves a
            variety of
            weapons
            and other items that can be used to help capture the flag, such as speed boosts, invisibility, and traps.
          </p>
          <p class="game-loby__main__p">
            There are different variations of CTF, such as One-Flag CTF, in which players compete to capture a single
            flag
            and bring
            it back to their base, and Two-Flag CTF, in which players compete to capture both flags and bring them back
            to
            their
            base. The game mode is often played in first-person shooter video games, as well as in real-life events and
            competitions.

            game Team
            Fortress 2. In this
            mode, two
            teams compete to capture and hold a series of control points located throughout the map. The objective is to
            hold the
            majority of the control points, which then begins to tick down a timer. Once the timer reaches zero, the
            team
            with the
            most control points wins the round.
          </p>
          <p class="game-loby__main__p">Each control point has a capture area that players must enter and stand within
            to
            capture the point. The more
            players
            standing in the capture area, the faster the point is captured. Once a team captures a control point, they
            must
            defend
            it from enemy players who will try to retake it.
          </p>
          <p class="game-loby__main__p">The game mode is fast-paced and requires teams to work together to coordinate
            their
            attacks and defenses.
            Players can
            switch classes and weapons to best suit the situation and can earn points for capturing and holding control
            points,
            killing enemies, and performing other actions.
