        collect
        ammunition or boosts scattered throughout the map. The game continues until one team reaches the designated
        number of
        kills or until a set time limit expires.

        In Team Deathmatch, players earn points for killing enemy players, and they lose points for being killed by an
        opponent.
        Points are used to rank players on a leaderboard, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is
        declared
        the winner.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Capture The Flag</h3>
      <p>
        Capture The Flag (CTF) is a popular game mode in which two teams compete against each other to capture a flag
        placed in
        the opponent’s territory and bring it back to their own base. The objective of the game is to gain control of
        the flag
        and protect it from the enemy team. The team that captures the flag the most times within a set time limit wins
        the
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each team has a designated base, where their flag is located, and the teams must defend their flag while
        attempting to
        capture the opponent’s flag. Players can respawn after they are killed, and the game often involves a variety of
        weapons
        and other items that can be used to help capture the flag, such as speed boosts, invisibility, and traps.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different variations of CTF, such as One-Flag CTF, in which players compete to capture a single flag
        and bring
        it back to their base, and Two-Flag CTF, in which players compete to capture both flags and bring them back to
        their
        base. The game mode is often played in first-person shooter video games, as well as in real-life events and
        competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, Capture The Flag is a fast-paced and challenging game mode that requires teamwork, strategy, and quick
        reflexes
        to win.
      </p>


      <h3>Control Point</h3>
      <p>Control Point is a game mode in the popular multiplayer first-person shooter game Team Fortress 2. In this
        mode, two
        teams compete to capture and hold a series of control points located throughout the map. The objective is to
        hold the
        majority of the control points, which then begins to tick down a timer. Once the timer reaches zero, the team
        with the
        most control points wins the round.
      </p>
      <p>Each control point has a capture area that players must enter and stand within to capture the point. The more
        players
        standing in the capture area, the faster the point is captured. Once a team captures a control point, they must
        defend
        it from enemy players who will try to retake it.
      </p>
      <p>The game mode is fast-paced and requires teams to work together to coordinate their attacks and defenses.
        Players can
        switch classes and weapons to best suit the situation and can earn points for capturing and holding control
        points,
        killing enemies, and performing other actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control Point is a popular mode for players who enjoy objective-based games with a focus on teamwork and
        strategy.
